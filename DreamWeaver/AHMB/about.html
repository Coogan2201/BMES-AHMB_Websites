		<h1>Our History</h1>
		<p>&emsp;The Department of Bioengineering was founded and ABET accreditted within the Watson School of Engineeringat  Binghamton University in 2002 with a focus on complex systems and computational biology. In Spring 2015, the deparment was renamed to the Department of Biomedical Engineering and a new ABET accredited undergraduate curriculum was approved focusing on the application of biology and engineering in the medical field with technical tracks in tissue and cellular engineering, biomedical devices, and biomechanics.
		</p>
		<p>Following this curriculum change, our chapter of Alpha Eta Mu Beta was founded in October 2015 by the first undergraduates to endure the new curriculum, the BME graduating class of 2016. By working with our peers, faculty, and student organizations such as BMES it is our goal to begin and continue to promote the BME presence at Binghamton and develop a sense of community within the department.</p>

		<h1>National History</h1>
		<p>&emsp;Alpha Eta Mu Beta is the National Biomedical Engineering Honor Society. Established in 1979, Alpha Eta Mu Beta was formed to recognize and encourage excellence in the field of Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering. Membership into Alpha Eta Mu Beta consists of those individuals in the field of Biomedical Engineering or Bioengineering who through their attainments in college or in practice have manifested a deep interest and marked ability in their chosen life work. The purpose of Alpha Eta Mu Beta is to bring these individuals into closer union so as to promote an understanding of the profession. Membership to Alpha Eta Mu Beta is a privilege and an honor. Members of Alpha Eta Mu Beta are recognized in an outstanding manner for having conferred honor on their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship, exemplary character, honorable activities, and leadership. Through various development, training, networking and service opportunities, members of Alpha Eta Mu Beta are able to learn and grow. In this process, they develop critical lifelong skills that prepare them to excel for the post college environment or to transform individuals at their present jobs into leaders and innovators. 

The field of Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering are constantly evolving, therefore over the years AEMB has transformed itself into a dynamic organization to meet the needs of its growing membership and alumni, the institutions that they serve and our society. </p>
